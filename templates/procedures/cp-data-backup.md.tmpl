{{companyShortName}} performs automatic backup of all customer and system data to protect
against catastrophic loss due to unforeseen events that impact the entire
system. 

An automated process will back up all data to a separate County managed data center within the Western North Carolina Region. At minimum, data will be backed up
daily. The backups are encrypted in the same way as live production data.

Customers can also utilize the {{companyShortName}} Application Programming Interface (API)
to extract and store their data elsewhere. DO WE DO THIS WITH ANY OF OUR DEPENDENTANT SYSTEMS (WORKDAY?)

#### Source code

{{companyShortName}} stores its source in git repositories hosted by {{sourceControl}}.

Source code repositories are backed up to {{companyShortName}}â€™s AWS S3 infrastructure
account on a weekly basis with a common set of configuration for each repository
to enforce SDLC processes.

In the event that {{sourceControl}} suffers a catastrophic loss of data, source code
will be restored from the backups in xxx.

Because Azure and {{sourceControl}} can both host git repositories, we are able to
leverage git's ability to maintain a full history of all changes to our git
repos via the commit log.

#### Business records and documents

User files produced on local equipment are automatically replicated to MS OneDrive, as part of O365. 

Files stored within MS SharePoint, Teams, Network File Shares, and other repositories will be backedup XXX HOW FREQUENTLY, and retained for at least 6 years in accordance with HIPAA and CJIS best practices.
