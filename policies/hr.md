# HR and Personnel Security

`2022.1`

Buncombe County is committed to ensuring all workforce members actively address
security and compliance in their roles at Buncombe County. We encourage self management
and reward the right behaviors. This policy specifies acceptable use of end-user
computing devices and technology. Additionally, training is imperative to
assuring an understanding of current best practices, the different types and
sensitivities of data, and the sanctions associated with non-compliance.

## Policy Statements

In addition to the roles and responsibilities stated [earlier](rar.md),
Buncombe County policy requires all workforce members to comply with the
Acceptable Use Policy for End-use Computing and HR Security Policy.

Buncombe County policy requires that:

(a) Background verification checks on all candidates for employees and
contractors should be carried out in accordance with relevant laws, regulations,
and ethics, and proportional to the business requirements, the classification of
the information to be accessed, and the perceived risk.

(b) Employees, contractors and third party users must agree and sign the terms
and conditions of their employment contract, and comply with acceptable use.

(c) Employees will go through an onboarding process that familiarizes them with
the environments, systems, security requirements, and procedures Buncombe County has in
place. Employees will also have ongoing security awareness training that is
audited.

(d) Employee offboarding will include reiterating any duties and
responsibilities still valid after terminations, verifying that access to any
Buncombe County systems has been removed, as well as ensuring that all company owned
assets are returned.

(e) Buncombe County and its employees will take reasonable measures to
ensure no sensitive data is transmitted via digital communications such as email
or posted on social media outlets.

(f) Buncombe County will maintain a list of prohibited activities that will be part of
onboarding procedures and have training available if/when the list of those
activities changes.

(g) A fair disciplinary process will be utilized for employees are suspected of
committing breaches of security. Multiple factors will be considered when
deciding the response such as whether or not this was a first offense, training,
business contracts, etc. Buncombe County reserves the right to terminate employees in
the case of serious cases of misconduct.
