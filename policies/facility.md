# Facility Access and Physical Security

`2022.1`

It is the goal of Buncombe County to provide a safe and secure environment
for all employees. Access to the Buncombe County facilities is limited to
authorized individuals only.

Buncombe County works with Subcontractors (e.g. property management
companies and facilities management) to assure restriction of physical access to
systems used as part of the Buncombe County Platform.

Physical Access to all of Buncombe County facilities is limited to only
those authorized in this policy. All workforce members are
responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized visitor and/or
unauthorized access to Buncombe County's facility.

Buncombe County and its Subcontractors control access to the physical
buildings/facilities that house these systems/applications, or in which
Buncombe County workforce members operate, in accordance to the HIPAA
Security Rule 164.310 and its implementation specifications. In an effort to
safeguard ePHI from unauthorized access, tampering, and theft, access is allowed
to areas only to those persons authorized to be in them and with escorts for
unauthorized persons.
