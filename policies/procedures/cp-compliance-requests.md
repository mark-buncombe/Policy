### Requesting Audit and Compliance Reports

Buncombe County, at its sole discretion, shares audit reports, including
any Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) and exceptions, with customers on a case by case
basis. All audit reports are shared under explicit NDA in Buncombe County format
between Buncombe County and party to receive materials. Audit reports can be requested
by Buncombe County workforce members for Customers or directly by Buncombe County Customers.

The following process is used to request audit reports:

1. A request may be sent by email to
   [compliance@buncombecounty.org](mailto:compliance@buncombecounty.org)
   or by submitting a request via Buncombe County Internal Support Portal
   or Email. In the request, please specify the type of report being requested
   and any required timelines for the report.
2. An Issue with the details of the request into the Buncombe County Security Project
   on github, which is used to track requests status and outcomes.
3. Buncombe County security team will confirm if a current NDA is in place with the
   party requesting the audit report. If there is no NDA in place, Buncombe County will
   send one for execution.
4. Once it has been confirmed that an NDA is executed, Buncombe County staff will move
   the github Issue to "Under Review".
5. The Buncombe County Security Officer or Privacy Officer must Approve or Reject the
   Issue. If the Issue is rejected, Buncombe County will notify the requesting party
   that we cannot share the requested report.
4. If the Issue has been Approved, Buncombe County will send the customer the requested
   audit report and complete the github Issue for the request.

#### External Audits of Information Access and Activity

Prior to contracting with an external audit firm, Buncombe County shall:

* Choose an audit firm that is independent of other organizational operations
* Ensure technical competence of the audit firm staff
* Require the audit firm's adherence to applicable codes of professional ethics
* Assign organizational responsibility for supervision of the external audit
  firm
* Obtain a signed HIPAA business associate agreement, if any ePHI will be shared/accessed during the audit
