### Support and Management of BYOD Devices

Buncombe County provides company-issued laptops and workstations to all employees.



Buncombe County currently does not require or support employees bringing their own
computing devices.

The end-user computing devices are self managed. Each Buncombe County employee is
responsible to

* configure their laptop/workstation to meeting the [configuration and
  management requirements](ccm.md); and

* ensure the latest security patches are installed or auto-update is enabled.

IT and Security provides automated scripts for end-user system configurations
and/or technical assistance as needed.  Such configurations are audited daily
using **Jamf** centrally managed by the Security team.
