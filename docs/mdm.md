# Mobile Device Security and Storage Media Management

`2022.1`

Buncombe County recognizes that media containing sensitive data may be
reused when appropriate steps are taken to ensure that all stored sensitive data
has been effectively rendered inaccessible. Destruction/disposal of sensitive
data shall be carried out in accordance with federal and state law. The schedule
for destruction/disposal shall be suspended for sensitive data involved in any
open investigation, audit, or litigation.

Buncombe County utilizes virtual storage repositories such as AWS EBS
volumes and S3 buckets to store production data.  Volumes and repositories
utilized by Buncombe County and Buncombe County Customers are
encrypted. Buncombe County does not use, own, or manage any mobile devices,
removable storage media, or backup tapes that have access to sensitive data.

## Policy Statements

Buncombe County policy requires that:

(a) All media, including mobile and removable media, storing Buncombe County company
data must be encrypted.

(b) Critical data as defined in [Buncombe County data classification model
Â§data-management](data-mgmt.md) may not be stored on mobile devices or removable
media such as USB flash drives.

(c) All destruction/disposal of sensitive data storage media will be done in
accordance with federal and state laws and regulations and pursuant to the
Buncombe County's written retention policy/schedule.

  * Records that have satisfied the period of retention will be
    destroyed/disposed of in an appropriate manner.
  * Records involved in any open investigation, audit or litigation should not
    be destroyed/disposed of.

(d) All sensitive data must rendered inaccessible in a forensically sound manner
prior to media reuse or disposal.

(e) Mobile devices, including laptops, smart phones and tables, used in support
of critical business operations shall be fully managed and/or audited by
Buncombe County IT and Security.



## Controls and Procedures


### Media Disposal Process

IT and Security is responsible to ensure media containing critical / sensitive
data is disposed securely in the following manner:

* The methods of destruction, disposal, and reuse are reassessed periodically,
  based on current technology, accepted practices, and availability of timely
  and cost-effective destruction, disposal, and reuse technologies and services.
  This may include

    - Secure wipe;
    - Physical destruction;
    - Destruction of encryption keys (if the data on the media is encrypted
      using a strong algorithm such as AES-256).

* If the records have been requested in the course of a judicial or
  administrative hearing, a qualified protective order will be obtained to
  ensure that the records are returned to the organization or properly
  destroyed/disposed of by the requesting party.

* All Buncombe County Subcontractors provide that, upon termination of the contract,
  they will return or destroy/dispose of all patient health information. In
  cases where the return or destruction/disposal is not feasible, the contract
  limits the use and disclosure of the information to the purposes that prevent
  its return or destruction/disposal.

*  In the cases of a Buncombe County Customer terminating a contract with
   Buncombe County and no longer utilize Buncombe County Services,
   data will be returned or disposed per contract agreement or
   Buncombe County Platform use terms and conditions. In all cases it is
   solely the responsibility of the Buncombe County Customer to maintain
   the safeguards required of laws and regulations once the data is transmitted
   out of Buncombe County environments.


### Use of USB Flash Drive and External Storage Device

Per Buncombe County corporate policy, confidential and critical data may
not be stored on external devices such as USB flash drives.
This includes and is not limited to ePHI.
For definition of confidential and critical data, see
Buncombe County Data Classification and Handling Policy.

Usage of USB flash drives for temporary transfer of confidential and critical
data may be allowed on a case by case basis, when the following process is
followed:

*   Data is only allowed on encrypted flash devices approved by Buncombe County
    Security and the IT Manager (currently **IronKey**).
*   The process starts with the submission of a ticket in github.
    The ticket must be approved by IT and Security.
*   Upon completion of data transfer all sensitive data on the device must be
    completely removed.
*   The device is to be returned to the IT Manager to double check that the data
    has been removed.
*   The IT Manager will check the drive back in.


### Support and Management of BYOD Devices

Buncombe County provides company-issued laptops and workstations to all employees.



Buncombe County currently does not require or support employees bringing their own
computing devices.

The end-user computing devices are self managed. Each Buncombe County employee is
responsible to

* configure their laptop/workstation to meeting the [configuration and
  management requirements](ccm.md); and

* ensure the latest security patches are installed or auto-update is enabled.

IT and Security provides automated scripts for end-user system configurations
and/or technical assistance as needed.  Such configurations are audited daily
using **Jamf** centrally managed by the Security team.
